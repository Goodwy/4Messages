 * When the SMS contentprovider is changed by a process other than us, we need to sync the Uri that
 * was changed.
 *
 * This can happen if a message is sent through something like Pushbullet or Google Assistant.
 *
 * This only works on API 24+, so to fully solve this problem we'll need a smarter way of running
 * partial syncs on older devices.
